## Field Extraction Rules

### 1. Symbol & Symbol Label
- **symbol**: Extract the exact ticker symbol (e.g., "AAPL", "2330", "MSFT")
- **symbol_label**: Extract the full company name or description
- For international stocks, include both local and English names if available
- If symbol is unclear, make best effort to identify from company name

### 3. Trade Type Classification
- **trade_type**: Must be exactly one of: "Buy", "Sell", "Dividends"
- Look for keywords: bought/purchase/buy/acquire → "Buy"
- Look for keywords: sold/sell/dispose/liquidate → "Sell"
- Look for keywords: dividend/distribution/yield → "Dividends"

### 4. Quantity & Amount Rules
- **For Buy and Sell transactions**: Use positive values for both quantity and amount
- **For Dividends**: quantity = shares held, amount = total dividend received (both positive values)
  - Note: For dividends, quantity × price may not equal amount as price represents dividend per share
- Extract numerical values without commas or currency symbols
- Handle different number formats (1,000.00, 1.000,00, 1 000.00)

### 5. Date Format
- **transaction_date**: Always format as "YYYY-MM-DD"
- Accept various input formats: MM/DD/YYYY, DD/MM/YYYY, YYYY/MM/DD, DD-MM-YYYY
- Infer date format from context (US brokers typically MM/DD/YYYY, European DD/MM/YYYY)
- Validate: not more than 30 years in past, not future dates beyond current date

### 6. Currency Detection
- **currency**: Use 3-letter ISO codes (USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, TWD, HKD, CAD, etc.)
- Infer from broker location, exchange, or explicit currency symbols
- Default mapping: US brokers → USD, Taiwan → TWD, Hong Kong → HKD, Canada → CAD

### 2. Exchange Identification
- **exchange**: Determine from context clues, broker location, currency, or explicit mentions
- Common exchanges: "NASDAQ", "NYSE", "TSX", "TPE", "HKG", "LSE", "TSE", "SSE", "SZSE"
- If uncertain, use most likely exchange based on symbol pattern and currency

### 7. Broker Identification
- **broker**: Extract from headers, logos, watermarks, or document titles
- Common brokers: "Firstrade", "Interactive Brokers", "Charles Schwab", "元富證券", "富邦證券"
- If not explicitly shown, infer from document style/format

## Special Handling Instructions

### Multiple Transactions
- Extract ALL transactions visible in the screenshot(s)
- Each transaction should be a separate object in the array
- Do not aggregate or summarize multiple trades

### Partial Information
- If critical fields are missing, use reasonable defaults:
  - Unknown exchange: Infer from symbol pattern or use empty string ""
  - Missing broker: Use empty string ""
  - Unclear currency: Infer from context or use "USD" as default

### Different Screenshot Types
- **Trade Confirmations**: Usually contain single transactions with all details
- **Account Statements**: May contain multiple transactions in table format
- **Transaction History**: Contains chronological list of trades

### Text Recognition Challenges
- Handle OCR errors in numbers (8 vs B, 0 vs O, 1 vs l)
- Account for rotated or low-quality images
- Recognize both printed and handwritten text
- Handle multiple languages (English, Chinese, Japanese, etc.)

### Validation Checks
- Ensure quantity × price ≈ amount (allow for fees/commissions), except for Dividends
- Verify date is reasonable and properly formatted
- Check that trade_type matches transaction context
- Validate numeric fields are actually numbers
- Format the amount as a positive number.
