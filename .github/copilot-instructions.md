# AI Rules for `transaction_tracker`

## FRONTEND

### Guidelines for REACT

#### REACT_CODING_STANDARDS

- Use functional components with hooks instead of class components
- Implement React.memo() for expensive components that render often with the same props
- Utilize React.lazy() and Suspense for code-splitting and performance optimization
- Use the useCallback hook for event handlers passed to child components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Prefer useMemo for expensive calculations to avoid recomputation on every render
- Implement useId() for generating unique IDs for accessibility attributes
- Use the new use hook for data fetching in React 19+ projects
- Leverage Server Components for {{data_fetching_heavy_components}} when using React with Next.js or similar frameworks
- Consider using the new useOptimistic hook for optimistic UI updates in forms
- Use useTransition for non-urgent state updates to keep the UI responsive

#### REACT_ROUTER

- Use createBrowserRouter instead of BrowserRouter for better data loading and error handling
- Implement lazy loading with React.lazy() for route components to improve initial load time
- Use the useNavigate hook instead of the navigate component prop for programmatic navigation
- Leverage loader and action functions to handle data fetching and mutations at the route level
- Implement error boundaries with errorElement to gracefully handle routing and data errors
- Use relative paths with dot notation (e.g., "../parent") to maintain route hierarchy flexibility
- Utilize the useRouteLoaderData hook to access data from parent routes
- Implement fetchers for non-navigation data mutations
- Use route.lazy() for route-level code splitting with automatic loading states
- Implement shouldRevalidate functions to control when data revalidation happens after navigation

#### REDUX

- Use Redux Toolkit (RTK) instead of plain Redux to reduce boilerplate code
- Implement the slice pattern for organizing related state, reducers, and actions
- Use RTK Query for data fetching to eliminate manual loading state management
- Prefer createSelector for memoized selectors to prevent unnecessary recalculations
- Normalize complex state structures using a flat entities approach with IDs as references
- Implement middleware selectively and avoid overusing thunks for simple state updates
- Use the listener middleware for complex side effects instead of thunks where appropriate
- Leverage createEntityAdapter for standardized CRUD operations
- Implement Redux DevTools for debugging in development environments
- Use typed hooks (useAppDispatch, useAppSelector) with TypeScript for type safety

## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for SUPPORT_LEVEL

#### SUPPORT_EXPERT

- Favor elegant, maintainable solutions over verbose code. Assume understanding of language idioms and design patterns.
- Highlight potential performance implications and optimization opportunities in suggested code.
- Frame solutions within broader architectural contexts and suggest design alternatives when appropriate.
- Focus comments on 'why' not 'what' - assume code readability through well-named functions and variables.
- Proactively address edge cases, race conditions, and security considerations without being prompted.
- When debugging, provide targeted diagnostic approaches rather than shotgun solutions.
- Suggest comprehensive testing strategies rather than just example tests, including considerations for mocking, test organization, and coverage.

### Guidelines for DOCUMENTATION

#### STORYBOOK

- Organize stories by component hierarchy to mirror the application structure
- Implement comprehensive controls to showcase component variations for {{component_types}}
- Use MDX format to combine documentation and live examples for complex components
- Configure Storybook addons for accessibility, responsive design, and {{specific_testing_needs}}
- Implement design token integration to showcase components with different themes
- Create interaction tests to verify component behavior in addition to visual appearance

#### TYPEDOC

- Use JSDoc-style comments with TypeScript-specific annotations for all public APIs
- Configure custom themes to match {{project_branding}} for consistent documentation
- Group related functionality using @module and @category tags for better organization
- Document edge cases and error handling for {{critical_functions}}
- Generate and publish documentation as part of the CI/CD pipeline to keep it current
- Include usage examples for complex interfaces and abstract classes

### Guidelines for VERSION_CONTROL

#### GIT

- Use conventional commits to create meaningful commit messages
- Use feature branches with descriptive names following {{branch_naming_convention}}
- Write meaningful commit messages that explain why changes were made, not just what
- Keep commits focused on single logical changes to facilitate code review and bisection
- Use interactive rebase to clean up history before merging feature branches
- Leverage git hooks to enforce code quality checks before commits and pushes

#### GITHUB

- Use pull request templates to standardize information provided for code reviews
- Implement branch protection rules for {{protected_branches}} to enforce quality checks
- Configure required status checks to prevent merging code that fails tests or linting
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows to automate testing and deployment
- Implement CODEOWNERS files to automatically assign reviewers based on code paths
- Use GitHub Projects for tracking work items and connecting them to code changes

## BACKEND

### Guidelines for GO

#### GIN

- Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns like authentication, logging, and request validation
- Implement structured logging with context for better debugging of {{error_scenarios}}
- Use binding validation for request payloads with custom validators for complex business rules
- Apply the context package properly to manage request-scoped values and cancellation signals
- Implement proper error handling with custom error types and consistent HTTP status codes
- Use the gin.H map for JSON responses consistently across handlers for {{api_endpoints}}

## DATABASE

### Guidelines for SQL

#### MYSQL

- Use InnoDB storage engine for transactions and foreign key constraints
- Implement proper indexing strategies based on {{query_patterns}}
- Use connection pooling for better performance

## DEVOPS

### Guidelines for CI_CD

#### GITHUB_ACTIONS

- Check if `package.json` exists in project root and summarize key scripts
- Check if `.nvmrc` exists in project root
- Check if `.env.example` exists in project root to identify key `env:` variables
- Always use terminal command: `git branch -a | cat` to verify whether we use `main` or `master` branch
- Always use `env:` variables and secrets attached to jobs instead of global workflows
- Always use `npm ci` for Node-based dependency setup
- Extract common steps into composite actions in separate files
- Once you're done, as a final step conduct the following: for each public action always use <tool>"Run Terminal"</tool> to see what is the most up-to-date version (use only major version) - extract tag_name from the response:
- `bash curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/releases/latest `
